# Wireframe-renderer-using-python-turtle

Learning the basic concepts of 3d rendering using python and turtle.

This is not optimized for highpoly models and is purely made for learning about 3d rendering also triangulation is not added in this project so download the models which is triangulated and with no quads or do so by your own means before opening it with the project if not did properly the models displayed will be broken beyond imagination.

This also supports rotating your model around its coordinate axes using the x, y, z keys

No additional modules are needed to be downloaded to run this.

Instructions:

  -use w, a, s, d, q, e keys for moving around the scene
  
  -mouse controls supported for camera movement
  
  -About the models I used to test this:
  
	-cube = very low poly

	-astronaut = low poly

	-mountains = large model

	-teapot = hello world to graphics testing

	-cat = high poly

  -To load your own models:

	-download them as a .obj file and place them in the same directory as the main.py file

	-run the program and select the model from the command line interface



NOTE: this is the code i submitted for my CBSE class 11 project so dont expect much from this.
